Create application Collections and Maps. It should contain one screen (Activity). And two tabs (Fragments): Collections and Maps.

Collections (ArrayList, LinkedList, CopyOnWriteArrayList):

Input: number of element to compare. I would recommend (1’000’000 - 10’000’000)

Output: grid with 8x3=24 cell (time in milliseconds):

Adding in the beginning;

Adding in the middle;

Adding in the end;

Search by value;

Removing in the beginning;

Removing in the middle;

Removing in the end.

Maps (TreeMap, HashMap):

Input: number of element to compare. I would recommend (1’000’000 - 10’000’000)

Output: grid with 3x2=4 cell (time in milliseconds):

Adding new;

Search by key;

Removing;

Application should have button “Calculate”.

When user click on it he can see loading.

Process can take a few seconds and should be saved, when Activity is destroyed.

Use ButterKnife for binding view
